Q0: If render_template is removed, there would be nothing to refer to when returning render_template()
Q1: https://localhost:5000/template/my_foist_template
Q2: 'model_tmplt.html' refers to the file, foo variable replaces the title with the string.

Expected Behaviors:
Website title returns fooooo, and the body would return the elements in coll with a newline/break after each element

After Running:
- Q1's url is different: http://127.0.0.1:5000/my_foist_template
- my_foist_template doesn't refer to a folder directory
-
