Notes:
-If not exists (avoids error in creating a table that already exists) so the database doesn't need to be deleted every time we run the code
-Checking if table has content (.fetchall() == 0)
-printing via fetchall (c.fetchall()= var. Then iterate through var to print.
-try and except
-sqlite.integrity error (error for duplicates)
-\ space allows for code to be continued on newline.
-? can substitute for vars for the sqlite insertion.
