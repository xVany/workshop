Q0: Where have you seen similar syntax in other langs?
- This is similar to using a constructor to initialize and object in Java
- Java -> objectName = objectType(parameterForConstructor)


Q1: What points of reference do you have for meaning of '/'?
- @app.route("/") contains the word route, therefore it may be related to the path of the app
- This could be the url which the app is related to


Q2: Where will this print to? Q3: What will it print?
- This will print to the terminal when you run the app

Q3: Will this appear anywhere? How u know?
- print(__name__) will print whatever __name__ is set to by default
- "No hablo queso!" will appear at the end destination of the route, which would be a website that is created when the program is run.


Q4: Where have you seen similar construcs in other languages?
- We have seen similar constructs in Java
- When running a function from another class or object
- className.function(parameters) and objectName.function(parameters)


Observations after running:
-Python3 app.py results in an error “no module named ‘flask’”
-python app.py results in:
 * Serving Flask app 'app' (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

    * The url is a blank website with the words "No hablo queso!"
    * url is the same despite being on different machines
* After quitting the app/program, __main__ is printed (think this was print(__name__) )
  * By default __name__ is set to __main__
