$ python3 -m venv ~/myherozero - sets up a python virtual environment in the specified directory:
Useful because when you have different projects that utilize various versions of Python and dependencies, you can keep them separate and organized
You can switch from virtual environment to virtual environment at any time, so you can change which dependencies / packages you’re working with and what version of Python you’re using on the fly
