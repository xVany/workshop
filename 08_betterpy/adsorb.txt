Questions:
Is it fine to work in float values or is it better to work in int?



Comments:
Can import choices from the random library. This is an easier way to choose a key based off the weight of its respective percentage
You can also do the weighted calculations by hand
Can use a try-except block for handling if the “occupations.txt” isn’t there
DictReader from the csv library is a useful tool for reading a csv file into a Dictionary.
Could also be done manually, but a lot more work.

Concerns:
We are very unconcerned!
