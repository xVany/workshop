K11 -- Flask and Static Files
SoftDev
2021-10-06

Observations
- Nowhere in app.py does it reference foo, foo.html, or the static folder
- When accessing the web page from the link given in the terminal it will function the exact same as v4 from K10
- URLs: http://localhost:5000/static/foo and http://localhost:5000/static/foo.html
  - Allows you to access the file even though app.py doesn't reference it
  - After the port (5000) is the path to the file from app.py's root directory

Predictions
- foo.html will work fine as that is what the webpage uses
  * foo.html did work properly
- foo will break as the plaintext file won't display properly
  * Accessing foo opens a prompt to download the text file
