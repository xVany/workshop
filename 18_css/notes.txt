K18 -- CSS basics
2021-11-23

- The html code for inline css is very cluttered and hard to digest
- In comparison, it is much easier to read the contents of the html code in the
internal and external CSS
- The internal and external CSS are similar, but the styling for external is
saved in a css file instead of in the html file
- Having the styling in another file makes it easier to concentrate on the
actual contents of the html file
