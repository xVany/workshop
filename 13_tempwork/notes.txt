EGOLESS PROGRAMMING:
-programmer that sees the code they write as an extension of themselves will not look for errors and sometimes even prove the code is correct.
-human eye will not see what it doesn't want to see; errors
-programmers should accept that errors will happen and work with others to see the errors.
-working in groups and staying in the group for a long time
-avoid personal possessive when refering to programs
