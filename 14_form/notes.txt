K14 -- notes for assignment where website to push out form inputs to another website
2021-10-14

<form action="/auth">: whenever the form is submitted, the first string appended to the URL is /auth
      <input type="text" name="username">: the second string appended to the URL is text with the username given
      <input type="submit" name="sub1">: this is sort of special because this is a button rendered by HTML. This is the third string appended to the URL: submit with sub1
</form> 
By default, the request type is a GET request for pulling website data. We think sending data is a POST request. Request and app seems to be predefined in flask (because we think it is initalized as blank and values are assigned later on).
